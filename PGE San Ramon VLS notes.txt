Jeanette the customer was actually very friendly and happy when I arrived.
She showed the touch panels are not recalling video wall preset layouts.
She also showed that the touch panel is not controlling audio.

Step 1. Downloaded control code from Extron IPCP 550 Pro at 192.168.1.250
Step 2. Revised emulated feedback to live feedback on all buttons where possible
Step 3. Reviewed barco processor code. Sample command:
               "C:\Program Files (x86)\Display Control\wallctl.exe" -Layout="C:\layouts\layout1.lay" -exit\x0d
               This tells me when the end user presses a layout button on the touch panel the command executes an application and recalls a layout stored at "c:\layouts" names "layout1.lay"
Step 4. Connected crash cart monitor/usb keyboard/mouse to Barco ECU-110 processor
               Review of contents in C:\layouts shows over a dozen preset layout files.
Step 5.  Opened "Display Control" software and went into to "Configure > Remote Command Line" and discovered the baud rates were set wrong.
               This immediately resolved the control issue, telling me that this setting was missed by previous service attempts.
Step 6.  Adjust all 26 layouts to fill screens appropriately. They're currently shifted to the right approx 227 pixels and therefore not filling the video wall correctly.
Step 7. Copied all layouts to USB drive for backup/future service



Notes 

               layout1-5          left edge of each vertical split      800, 1760, 2720, 4640, 5600
               layout6-10         left edge of each vertical split      800, 1760, 2717, 3674, 4640, 5600
               layout11-14        left edge of each vertical split      800, 1760, 3677, 5600
               layoutpc1-12       left edge of each vertical split      800, 1760, 5600


               
No changes to Extron control were necessary in this service call. 
This was resolved completely within the Barco ECU-110 processor. 


Step 8. Tested audio with Jeanette. 
               Studio B seems to be working now. I ran out of time and couldn't fix studio A.
               Live feed back on touch panel is slow. Perhaps IP control will be faster. 
               Audio is not routing correctly. I'm unclear what/why just yet.


Suggest bringing 50'-100' ethernet cable to connect to DSP systems from anywhere in the studios.
Crash cart is still connected to Barco. Customer is expecting service to return on Thursday.
Jeanette was very happy with everything I accomplished today.
